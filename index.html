    <h2>Learning for Fun</h2>
    <p id="description">
      We are a fun, youthful company that aims to teach math in a new, exciting way.<br>
      We have created a multiplication board game to play with family and friends at home and in the classroom.<br>
      What makes our game different is that we teach with a different strategy.<br>
      We show the multiplication answer on the game piece and the equation on the board and leave it up to the player to make different con-x-ions!<br>
      We have gotten two 10/10s and a 9/10.

    <h1>All About Blue Mountain</h1>
    <p> Blue Mountain is a ski resort located in The Blue Mountains, Ontario, Canada. The resort spans the Niagara Escarpment near the southern shore of Georgian Bay, and encompasses 147 hectares (360 acres) of skiable terrain with a vertical drop of 220 metres (720 ft). As of 2024, the resort maintains 43 named runs, which includes its four terrain parks.

The resort was established in 1941 by Jozo Weider and Gordon Peter Campbell, who acquired land on the escarpment from the Toronto Ski Club and the Blue Mountain Ski Club. In 1948, the resort signed a 999-year lease with the two ski clubs, securing use of their land on the mountain. The resort expanded its winter operations throughout the latter half of the 20th century. By the 1970s, the resort began introducing summer attractions, aiming to become a year-round destination. In 2000, construction began on its resort village, made possible after Intrawest acquired a 50 per cent stake in the company the year prior. In 2017, the resort was acquired by a consortium and consolidated under the Alterra Mountain Company.

The resort hosts several seasonal attractions throughout the year on its slopes and at its resort village at the base of the escarpment. The resort is the third busiest ski resort in Canada after Whistler Blackcomb and Mont Tremblant Resort.</p>

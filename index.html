    <h1>Canada's Blue Mountain</h1>
    
   <p>Have you ever thought about going skiing? If you have, then Blue Mountain is the place to be! <br>
	    Located in Ontario, Canada, it’s a fun mix of outdoor adventure and small-town charm.<br>
	    In the winter, you can ski down the slopes, and when the weather’s warmer, there’s still plenty to do. <br>
	    From roller coasters to grabbing a scoop of ice cream, there’s always something exciting happening.<br>
	    Blue Mountain really has a little bit of everything, whether you’re looking to relax or have the time of your life!<br></p>
